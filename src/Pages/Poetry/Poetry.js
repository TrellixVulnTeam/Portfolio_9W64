                    Lay down<br/>
                    Rest your weary sprit and soul<br/>
                    Float away<br/>
                    You can’t lose that which you lack <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you dream of paradise<br/>
                    It will come to you in a darkened flash<br/>
                    If you sing of a land without time<br/>
                    Every clock will turn to ash<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Go to sleep and don’t wake up<br/>
                    To find a peace youve been missing so<br/>
                    Hold my hand until all is still<br/>
                    That’s when you know you’re finally home<br/>

                    Are you coming back soon?<br/>
                    back from the sea that tried to drown you?<br/>
                    Are you going to come back and stay<br/>
                    before the wind sweeps you away?<br/>
                    Hold your ground as I always yell<br/>
                    never let yourself dwell<br/>
                    in the past so very hazy and black<br/>
                    Shelter yourself as fierce storms attack<br/>
                    You'll be okay if you stay here with me<br/>
                    but first you need to come back to reality.<br/>

                    There are some things people can't touch<br/>
                    They can't touch the pain<br/>
                    It cuts too deep within us<br/>
                    There are some things people can't touch<br/>
                    They can't touch the love<br/>
                    It's buried too close to our hearts<br/>
                    The only thing that can touch the pain is the love<br/>
                    And the love is worth the pain.<br/>

                    Will you let me know?<br/>
                    Will you keep your grip on me<br/>
                    Or will you let me go?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    A thousand days since you’ve been gone<br/>
                    But who’s been keeping track?<br/>
                    The farther into the future I go<br/>
                    The farther you pull me back<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You haunt my dreams, your shadow casts Its glow in my periphery<br/>
                    A constant reminder of what could have been<br/>
                    Now forever a mystery<br/>

                    Solar teardrops fall from your eyelashes<br/>
                    Illuminating the depth of your past<br/>
                    I fall deeper and deeper into your abyss<br/>
                    Untouched where no one dares go<br/>
                    Have you?<br/>
                    I drop through the gradient of time<br/>
                    light to dark<br/>
                    I dis integrate  <br/>
                    Maybe I'll fall forever, your eyes a black hole<br/>
                    Or crash, the weight of the earth beneath me <br/>
                    Crushing every fiber of my soul<br/>

                    How hard it must be that you can't sleep<br/>
                    Counting infinite herds of infinite sheep<br/>
                    Are there swarms of bugs on your sheets<br/>
                    Preventing you from falling asleep?<br/>
                    What keeps you awake at night all alone?<br/>
                    Is it the fear of missing some of tomorrow?<br/>
                    Is it fear of what you'll see in your dreams?<br/>
                    Or the fear that the future is closing on you faster than it seems?<br/>
                    I lie awake at night thinking of you<br/>
                    And of all that you do as you wait for the dark sky to again turn blue.<br/>
                    And I think if we are both waiting for the day to renew<br/>
                    We can wait together.<br/>
                    Our souls both at peace.<br/>

                    In the morning, the town is not yet alive<br/>
                    Or am I not alive, looking through dead eyes<br/>
                    Sometimes in the fog<br/>
                    I think there is nothing there at all<br/>
                    In the winter, when the trees are bare<br/>
                    They look like they're just sitting there<br/>
                    In the frosty snow<br/>
                    Waiting for the summer winds to blow<br/>
                    Or in the night, black as pitch<br/>
                    I see not even a twitch<br/>
                    But should a twitch pass me by<br/>
                    It would pass on unseeing eyes<br/>
                    For in the fog, in the dark, in the wintery chill<br/>
                    Everything seems remarkably still <br/>

                    When you look into my eyes you say <br/>
                    it’s all going to be okay<br/>
                    But I know you hide too<br/>
                    never reveal what you go through<br/>
                    sun shines on a brighter day<br/>
                    now it’s ominous, gloomy, grey<br/>
                    I wander on a darkened night<br/>
                    and you follow close, but out of sight<br/>
                    you’re the reason I wander, so I stray<br/>
                    from the regular path of a normal way<br/>
                    Do you wander too? I don’t know<br/>
                    River streams start to flow<br/>
                    You’re enveloped in darkness; you’ve been revived<br/>
                    Thank God for you to be alive.<br/>
                    But what is actual is not real<br/>
                    How then do you really feel?<br/>
                    You followed my path on that night long ago<br/>
                    when the river streams flowed and flow<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Truth can hurt so I want to protect<br/>
                    Plagued by some hideous defect<br/>
                    littered with flaws which threaten the strength<br/>
                    to hide what is present, I go to great length<br/>
                    dig a hole, you will not find<br/>
                    the creeping shadows in my mind<br/>
                    i will deceive before i’ll show<br/>
                    i will not reap what i have sown<br/>
                    my hands are tied, but not my will<br/>
                    a cup in the rain that will not fill<br/>
                    i do what it takes to win the prize<br/>
                    no matter the hearts; no matter the lies<br/>
                    don’t stop now. We’re on a roll.<br/>
                    x marks a spot on my soul<br/>
                    seek or don’t seek, both i fear<br/>
                    the closer you are, the more that is clear<br/>
                    <br/>
                    A noble steed black as pitch<br/>
                    will rescue me from some confinement or some ditch<br/>
                    the clothes on your back you willingly shed<br/>
                    when deep in my bones the cold infects<br/>
                    Ill hide away between the branches of a tree<br/>
                    caution floats among the breeze<br/>
                    wait and see. Wait and see.<br/>
                    do you know what you do to me?<br/>
